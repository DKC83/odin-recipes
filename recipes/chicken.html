   <img src="../img/chicken.jpg" alt="A delicious looking crispy chicken meal" width="700" height="700">
   <p>Sticky, sweet and the perfect level of crispy, this is a retro classic that never fails. You'll coat fried chicken in a honey-lemon sauce, and serve with rice and Tenderstem broccoli.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>160g Broccoli</li>
        <li>1 Red chilli</li>
        <li>5g Toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>4 tbsp Cornflour</li>
        <li>130g White long grain rice</li>
        <li>1 tsp Five-spice mix</li>
        <li>2 Chicken breast portions</li>
        <li>30ml Soy sauce</li>
        <li>25g Honey</li>
        <li>2 Spring onion</li>
        <li>1 Garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 Lemon</li>
    </ul>
   <h3>You'll also need</h3>
   <p>vegetable oil, sugar, pepper, butter, water</p>
   <h2>Method</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6</p>
        <p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat</p> 
        <p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Once the rice is done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p>
        <p>Whilst the rice is cooking, cut your Tenderstem broccoli in half</p>
        <p>Add the Tenderstem broccoli to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a large splash of cold water and a large knob of butter and add to a baking tray</p>
        <p>Scrunch the edges of the foil around the Tenderstem to form a sealed parcel, then put the tray in the oven for 15 min or until tender</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p>
        <p>Juice half of your lemon[s] into a bowl and cut 2 slices per person with your remaining lemon</p>
        <p>Add your honey, a sprinkle of your cornflour (you'll use the rest later!), half of your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and 100ml cold water to the bowl</p>
        <p>Give everything a good mix up – this is your lemon sauce</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Cut your chicken breast portion[s] lengthways into 2 strips per person, then cut each strip in half</p>
        <p>Add the remaining cornflour to a bowl along with 1 tsp [1 1/2 tsp] [2 tsp] sugar, your five-spice mix and a generous grind of black pepper and mix it all together</p>
        <p>Add the chicken strips to the bowl and give everything a good mix up until all the chicken is coated</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p>
        <p>Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken strips along with the remaining soy sauce and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden, crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken</p>
        <p>Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside (save the pan!)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice your spring onions finely</p>
        <p>Cut your red chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely</p>
        <p>Stir the sliced spring onion and chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) into the cooked rice – this is your chilli rice</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Return the pan to a medium-low heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil</p>
        <p>Once hot, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min until fragrant</p>
        <p>Once fragrant, add the lemon sauce and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce is thick and sticky</p>
        <p>Serve the crispy chicken and roasted Tenderstem broccoli over the chilli rice</p>
        <p>Drizzle the lemon sauce over the chicken and garnish with the reserved lemon slices and toasted sesame seeds</p>
    </li>
   </ol>
