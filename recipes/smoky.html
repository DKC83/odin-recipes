   <p>This stroganoff-inspired supper is easy comfort food. You'll add smoky paprika and chilli to chicken and mushrooms, before tumbling your linguine into the creamy sauce. Strogan-off the charts!</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>5.5g Chicken stock mix</li>
    <li>50g Soft cheese</li>
    <li>1 tsp Smoked paprika</li>
    <li>190g Linguine</li>
    <li>o.5 tsp Chilli flakes</li>
    <li>5.5g Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>2 Chicken breat portions</li>
    <li>80g Chestnut mushrooms</li>
    <li>10g Parsley</li>
    <li>1 Garlic clove</li>
    <li>1 Brown onion</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>You'll also need</h3>
   <p>butter, salt, vegetable oil, pepper, water</p>
   <h2>Method</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><p>Boil a kettle</p>
        <p>Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s], then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp vegetable oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat</p> 
        <p>Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 4-6 min or until soft and starting to brown</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>While the onion is softening, add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat</p>
        <p>Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite</p>
        <p>Once cooked, drain the linguine, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic and slice your chestnut mushrooms finely</p>
        <p>Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p>
        <p>Add your chilli flakes (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!), ground smoked paprika, Dijon mustard and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl</p>
        <p>Cut your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces and add to the bowl, then mix well and set aside – this is your smoky chicken</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high</p>
        <p>Add the sliced mushrooms and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until the mushrooms start to soften and brown slightly</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Once the mushrooms have started to soften, add the smoky chicken to the pan</p>
        <p>Add half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!)</p>
        <p>Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the chicken is beginning to brown</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 100ml reserved starchy pasta water</p>
        <p>Add the chicken stock to the pan, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for a further 6-8 min or until the liquid has reduced by half and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Add the drained linguine to the pan</p>
        <p>Tip: Give it a good stir to release the starch in the pasta and make the sauce naturally creamy</p>
        <p>Before the liquid has fully reduced, remove the pan from the heat and stir in your soft cheese – this is your smoky chicken & mushroom linguine</p>
        <p>Serve the smoky chicken & mushroom linguine</p>
        <p>Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley</p>
    </li>
   </ol>
