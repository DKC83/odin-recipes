     <li>1 Sping onion</li>
     <li>2 Garclic cloves</li>
     <li>1 Red pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>You'll also need</h3>
    <p>pepper, salt, sugar, vegetable oil</p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
     <li><p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7</p>
         <p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add to a baking tray with your five-spice mix, a drizzle of vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp sugar and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p> 
     </li>
     <li>
         <p>While the chips are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very large drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p>
         <p>Add the diced chicken breast to a bowl with the cornflour and give it a good mix up until all the chicken is coated</p>
     </li>
     <li>
         <p>Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken</p>
         <p>Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside and reserve the pan</p>
     </li>
     <li>
         <p>Chop your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small cubes</p>
         <p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger</p>
         <p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p>
         <p>Finely slice your red chilli[es] into rounds</p>
         <p>Trim, then finely slice your spring onion</p>
     </li>
     <li>
         <p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with any remaining oil</p>
         <p>Add the chopped pepper, ginger and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant</p>
         <p>Meanwhile, add your soy sauce to a bowl with your honey, chilli relish and Chinese rice wine – this is your sticky chilli sauce</p>
     </li>
     <li>
         <p>Add the sticky chilli sauce to the pan and cook for 3 min or until the sauce begins to thicken and the pepper has softened</p>
         <p>While the sauce thickens, chop your coriander finely, including the stalks</p>
         <p>Once thickened, add the crispy chicken to the pan and cook for 1 min further until the chicken is coated in the sauce – this is your sticky chilli chicken</p>
     </li>
     <li>
         <p>Once the chips are cooked, add the remaining chopped garlic, chopped spring onion and chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the tray and give everything a good mix up – these are your salt & pepper chips</p>
         <p>Serve the sticky chilli chicken with the salt & pepper chips to the side</p>
         <p>Garnish with the chopped coriander</p>
     </li>
    </ol>
